    					Modern Hieroglyphics is a biannual art and design publication created by Jack McKain (myself) and Chor Boogie, featuring a diverse range of artists from all over the world. It all began while I was wandering around San Francisco in May 2013. I was exploring Clarion Alley, a community mural project in the heart of San Francisco's Mission District, through which artists have received permission to paint all over the alley walls. I found a mural by Chor Boogie, titled "Opium Horizons," and I was excited to see his art in the alley after following his work for years. He's painted pieces for Hugh Hefner, Jay-Z, Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, and even the Beijing Olympics. I got ahold of his agent Dana, and Chor called back to invite me to his studio.
 						<br><br>
						When I arrived, we sat down for an interview and I got to check out some of his latest work. During the interview, Chor told me about a mural he painted in 2012 in Baton Rouge called "Modern Hieroglyphics." As soon as he mentioned that name, I couldn't get it out of my head.
 						<br><br>
						That night, back in San Francisco, I was stoked on what had just gone down. I wanted to continue to interview artists and create a platform to share these conversations. I called Chor back that night to ask him if I could use the name of that piece as the name of this project, and to see if he wanted to get involved. He was all about it; Modern Hieroglyphics was born.
